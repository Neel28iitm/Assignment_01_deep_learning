This repository contains the implementation of a feedforward neural network with backpropagation using NumPy for the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The code is structured as follows:

│── question1.py      # Implementation for Question 1
│── question2.py      # Implementation for Question 2
│── question3.py      # Implementation for Question 3
│── question9.py      # Implementation for Question 9
│── train.py          # Main script for training the model
│── README.md         # Documentation for the project
│── data/             # Directory containing dataset files
│   └── FashionMNIST/raw/  # Raw Fashion-MNIST dataset files
│── Question No10.pdf # Reference document with problem details

Usage

Run train.py to train the model:
python train.py

Modify the relevant question scripts (question1.py, question2.py, etc.) as needed to experiment with different configurations.

Dependencies:
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
pip install numpy matplotlib
For further details, refer to the respective Python files.
